      <h1>Welcome to The Shoe Store</h1>
      <br>
      <p>this application has been created as a homework assignment for candidates applying for Testing Roles.  In the same way you wouldn't hire a musician before hearing some notes, we'd like to see you play a little bit for us. It shouldn't take very long to finish, and we hope it is an enjoyable and challenging task.</p>

        <h2>The backstory</h2>
        <p>Shoe Store has established itself as the newest source for getting the latest shoe fashions. Founded by a group of elite fasion consultants a couple of hours ago and growing very rapidly, The Shoe Store has just hired their first Sales Director, Mark.  Mark did not miss a beat; he put together a team to write their first website. Lacking an online presence when you're selling any kind of product these days is unacceptable!  So, since the first release has to get out the door as soon as possible, The Shoe Site has agreed to not worry about processing credit cards, cross-selling or even doing any kind of content management for now: it's just displaying the newest shoe releases, and nothing else. The UI needs to be finished, and currently has no bells and whistles: enough to be able to display each months new releases properly, and that's about it. It needs to behave relatively similar across all commonly used browsers in use today, but doesn't have to be pixel-perfect.</p>
